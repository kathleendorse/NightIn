### About NightIn

Night In is a food and drink application that helps Wine and Food lovers alike curate perfectly matched meals. Starting with a meal of the user’s choice, Wine and Dine’s proprietary recommendation engine will suggest a nice drink pairing with your dinner. Users are able to create an account and store past pairings to your account history for future reference. Finally, Wine and Dine allows users to get the night started with a built-in shopping list.
